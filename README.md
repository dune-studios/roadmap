# Discord Lite road map
- Copy videos and images by right-clicking
- Tray icon with ping count
- Copy embed links by right clicking
- Better Discord support (Don't add theme support if it's not working) 

### and now my suggested features:
- Add RPC (like the activity thing)
- ~~Add spotify support~~ (already works)
- F12 to open [DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)
- [Discord Experiments](https://github.com/NotNexuss/Discord-Experiments) (same as devtools pretty much)
