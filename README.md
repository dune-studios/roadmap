# Discord Lite road map
- Copy videos and images by right-clicking
- Tray icon with ping count
- Copy embed links by right clicking
- ~~Better Discord support (Don't add theme support if it's not working)~~ Not possible due to it being PC Client only
- Goosemod, Cumcord (Real mod btw) support? Any Discord mod besides BD.

### and now my suggested features:
- Add RPC (like the activity thing)
- ~~Add spotify support~~ (already works)
- [DiscordDarker](https://github.com/dune-studios/discorddarker) support ;)))
